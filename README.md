# ImageToLaTeX
(Tensorflow implementation)
Converting images of mathematical formulas to their corresponding LaTeX code using end to end convolutional networks (architecture inspired from https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03122). Original proposed model is evaluated by replacing the convolutional encoder and convolutional decoder by bidiectional lstm.
